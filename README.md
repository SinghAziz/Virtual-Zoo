# Virtual-Zoo

#Problem Number - CBP40
#Problem Statement- Virtual Zoo	Smart Education	Design software and hardware to display holograms of existing and extinct species of flora and fauna to depict complex ecosystems from various parts of the world. The virtual zoo could be displayed in schools, museums, and Ministries without using much physical space. The zoo could also hold educational sessions about the environment within the virtual space using pre-recorded videos of teachers from around the world.

Problem Solution Ideas-
Software-A platform where holograms of endangered, extinct and existing species of both Flora and Fauna are there, the species will be sorted respectively. Anyone can access this.
Hardware-A hardware model which will be very low cost that when kept on screen after playing the video will show the hologram in air. This can be used by anyone and everyone.
